## Model Architectures and Results

This project explores four principal methodologies for ECG anomaly detection, each chosen for its unique strengths in processing and analyzing time-series data. Below is a detailed overview of the architectures and the key results achieved with each model.

### LSTM Autoencoders

- **Architecture**: Designed specifically for sequential data like ECG signals, the LSTM Autoencoder comprises two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder uses LSTM layers to compress the input sequence into a lower-dimensional representation, capturing both immediate and long-term dependencies within the data. The decoder then reconstructs the input sequence from this compressed representation, aiming to highlight deviations in reconstructed outputs indicative of anomalies.
- **Results**: Demonstrated excellent performance in identifying anomalies through temporal analysis, capturing both immediate and distant dependencies within heartbeat sequences. It excels in reconstructing normal rhythm patterns, making it highly effective for anomaly detection over time.

### Traditional Autoencoders

- **Architecture**: Similar in concept to LSTM Autoencoders but without a specific focus on sequential data. The architecture features an encoder that compresses the input into a lower-dimensional space and a decoder that reconstructs the input from this compressed representation. The model utilizes linear layers and ReLU activations for the encoding process, with a Tanh layer for output normalization in the decoding process.
- **Results**: Effective in detecting significant reconstruction errors, thereby serving as a robust mechanism for identifying potential cardiac issues. Its flexibility allows it to be applied across various types of data, including ECG signals.

### Traditional Neural Networks

- **Architecture**: This approach employs a deep Neural Network model designed for binary classification. It consists of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activations to introduce non-linearity and a sigmoid output layer for the final classification. This architecture is tailored to distinguish between normal and abnormal heart rhythms with high precision.
- **Results**: Achieved near-perfect classification accuracy, demonstrating the capability of deep learning architectures in handling the nuances of medical data analysis, particularly in classifying heart rhythms into normal and abnormal categories efficiently.

### XGBoost Model

- **Architecture**: Utilizes the XGBoost algorithm, a scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting machines. The model is fine-tuned for the binary classification of ECG signals, optimizing its parameters to handle the specific challenges and characteristics of the dataset effectively.
- **Results**: Showcased high success rates in anomaly classification, rivalling the deep learning-based approaches in terms of precision and predictive power. Its efficiency in processing tabular data makes it a valuable tool for medical data analysis, especially when dealing with structured datasets like ECG recordings.

## Results
The comparative analysis of these models revealed the significant potential of integrating deep learning and machine learning techniques for the diagnosis and analysis of heart conditions through ECG data. While LSTM Autoencoders and traditional Autoencoders are particularly adept at identifying complex patterns and anomalies through reconstruction errors, traditional Neural Networks and the XGBoost model excel in direct classification tasks, offering high accuracy and efficiency. This diversity in approaches highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset in question.
